abstract: Chemical equilibria computations, especially those with vanishing species
  in the aqueous phase, lead to nonlinear systems that are difficult to solve due
  to gradient blow up. Instead of the commonly used ad hoc treatments, we propose
  two reformulations of the single-phase chemical equilibrium problem which are in
  line with the spirit of preconditioning but whose actual aims are to guarantee a
  better stability of Newton's method. The first reformulation is a parametrization
  of the graph linking species mole fractions to their chemical potentials. The second
  is based on an augmented system where this relationship is relaxed for the iterates
  by means of a Cartesian representation. We theoretically prove the local quadratic
  convergence of Newton's method for both reformulations. From a numerical point of
  view, we demonstrate that the two techniques are accurate, allowing to compute equilibria
  with chemical species having very low concentrations. Moreover, the robustness of
  our methods combined with a globalization strategy is superior to that of the literature.
